# POE2 Loot Filter - Simple Guide

Welcome to our shared Path of Exile 2 loot filter! 

This filter is designed to make our looting experience smoother and more efficient. Here are the key principles to remember:

## Main Guidelines

- "If it's written small, you can leave it on the ground." -> We could completely hide those if necessary
- "The bigger the text, the rarer the item."
- "If there's an icon on the minimap, it's worth picking up."

## How It Works

- **Text Size**: Indicates the rarity and value of items. Smaller text for common items, larger text for rare or valuable ones.

- **Minimap Icons**: Highlight important items. If you see an icon, the item is likely worth your attention.

- **Color Coding**: Helps quickly identify item value:
  - White: Very valuable items
  - Bright colors: Moderately valuable items
  - Other colors: Items to check based on your needs

## Installation

1. Download the .filter file
2. Place it in your POE2 folder (usually in 'Documents/My Games/Path of Exile 2')
3. Select the filter in the game options

Happy looting, Exiles!
